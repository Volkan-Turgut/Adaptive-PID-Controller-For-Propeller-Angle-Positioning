# Adaptive-PID-Controller-For-Propeller-Angle-Positioning

The project is to design a PID controller for a propeller arm angle positioning system where the system's one end is attached to a stable object, preferrably a table. The purpose is the get to the desired angle of the propeller arm with minimal error and as fast as possible. Of course the system must also be stable at the desired angle. A servo motor is connected to the propeller and the servo motor is driven by an Arduino Uno Board. The system gets the desired angle as an input, produces a motor drive as an output and it is constantly fed back with the current angle value. The project was both simulated and run on MATLAB Simulink.
